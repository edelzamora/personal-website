## ðŸ’¡ About

This is my personal website to use as a portfolio to showcase some projects and learn more about me. This is version 0.1.0.  
I am going to add more information about me and the projects. Also implement better responsiveness.  
My over all goal was to learn to how to use React.js, learn more javascript, how to use custom domains and deploy a web application to the internet.
